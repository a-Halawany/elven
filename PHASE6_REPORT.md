# Phase 6 — Decision Intelligence & Executive OS: implementation record

Branch `phase6-decisions`, from PR #44 at `c5460465aa3c9a551d15ee5f565c8986dd509a55`; plan
`PHASE6_BUILD_PLAN.md` (PR #45), approved 2026-09-08 with the five corrections incorporated before
the first implementation commit. Forward migrations `0041`–`0047`. One consolidated implementation
PR, unmerged behind C15 and FINAL C16/C17 in the recorded merge order. Evidence classes are kept
apart throughout: **harness** (the real PostgreSQL, pipeline and controllers), **browser**, the
**demonstration** (replay / live / synthetic, on a fresh deployment), **CI** at the candidate.

## 0. Freeze record

F1–F8 and §6a rules 1–11 as frozen in the plan at `4f88381`; the owner decisions of §10 (object codes
DPK/APR/BRF/RPL; `decision_authority` distinct from `decision_approver`; named humans and role-at-scope
with a quorum of distinct eligible humans; only the exact `decision.commit` at C3, C4 denied; branch
base; two synthetic personas and the weekly cadence). Nothing preserved by the plan was reopened:
the closed Phase 4, Phase 5, #43 and #44 reviews, the source decisions, cadences and budgets, the
forecast and twin limitations, the deferred automatic `CorrectionApplied` consumer.

## 1. P6-M1 — decision packages (`0041_decision_packages`)

Schema `decision`; seven roles; `DPK@v1` bound to `decision.package.propose`; packages bind to a
`DEC` a strategy owner declared through Phase 3's own port (a package never declares one);
versions are drafts until proposed and immutable after (trigger); options carry typed
consequence citations `{kind, id, version, digest}` resolved by the service under the caller's own
read authority (a run must be completed; an option without a run says why it is unsimulated);
**uncertainty is derived** from the cited objects' own records and never taken from the caller;
one common control baseline is required at proposal; the **choice** (option, the human's rationale,
deadline, accepted trade-offs, a named action owner, measurable outcome criteria with what they are
observed on) is inside the version digest; a new version carries terms and options, never the
choice; dissent is a named human's own append-only act. Dependencies from the `DEC` to the cited
runs and evidence go into `graph.dependencies`, so Phase 3's walk reaches the package.

**Harness** `test/int/phase6-decisions.test.ts` — 15/15: declare boundaries (OBJ refused, unknown
refused, non-human owner refused, approver/authority/executive/agent refused), C3 refused before any
port on every `decision.package.*` action, citations bound by version and digest with the derived
uncertainty, the decision agent's one write and the other roles' refusals, terms/choice/proposal
refusals (author cannot be the only approver), DPK admission and immutability (no direct
UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT after proposal), one common baseline, dissent append-only, version lineage.

## 2. P6-M2 — approvals and the exact C3 commit (`0042_decision_approvals_and_commitment`)

Approvals sign the digest that was read; eligibility is a named principal or a role at scope;
self-approval (author, proposer, owner, action owner) refused; expiry from the policy; revocation is
the approver's own act and moves an approved version back under review when quorum is lost; a live
quorum is recounted at commit. `decision.commit` is the **one** rule above C2 in the bundle: it
matches **exactly**, admits only `decision_authority` at the domain, carries the `human_gate`
obligation (the PEP refuses agents, workloads and non-session assurance with `EYE-WFL-002` before
any capability is minted), and C4 is denied. The commit route **pins** `consequenceClass: 'C3'`
whatever the envelope claims; the port verifies `eye_op_class() = 'C3'` and the bound action in the
authority context, the acting principal, the role at scope, locks the package, refuses a committer
who is an approver, and writes the bounded `CMT` into Phase 3's tables with its dependencies. `APR@v1`.

**Harness** `test/int/phase6-approvals.test.ts` — 11/11 (incl. two authorities committing
concurrently: exactly one succeeds; the human gate at the PEP with denials recorded; expiry ends an
approval and the commit recounts). **Unit** `test/unit/pdp-phase6-authority.test.ts` — 6/6 (exact
match, C2/C4 denied, every other role denied, the PEP is where humanity is decided).

## 3. P6-M3 — Decision Replay (`0043_decision_replay`, `0047_replay_prior_dissent`)

`decision.replay_layers` reconstructs five layers in the database: **known** (evidence the options
and the runs' twin versions cite, `recorded_at ≤ known_at`, event time `≤ observed_through` —
world time applies to `event_time`, never to the collection instant), **believed** (claims,
forecasts, assumptions at their cited versions with the verification they had at `known_at`,
branch states under both clocks, the twin's declared validation), **tested** (the runs' immutable
digests with `completed_at ≤ decided_at`, the twin versions they ran on with their verification as
of `decided_at`, reproduction verdicts `≤ decided_at`), **decided** (version and digest, dissent —
on this version and, from `0047`, on the earlier versions before the decision — approvals,
commitment, the commit's policy decision and audit record), **observed** (strictly after
`decided_at` and at or before the bound `as_of`). History and availability are kept apart: a
corrected cited version stays in its layer; withdrawal, governed deletion and unreadable objects
are reported in `unavailable` beside the content with the reason; the content digest covers the
cut-offs and contents only; the invocation (reader, instant, availability then) is stored beside
it in the `RPL@v1` record. One instant stamps `decided_at`, `committed_at` and the committed event.

**Harness** `test/int/phase6-replay.test.ts` — 5/5: equal content digests for three readers under
the same cut-offs and `as_of`; a correction keeps the cited version, a withdrawal becomes
unavailable; a later reproduction, revocation and walk land under observed; an earlier `as_of`
reproduces the first digest; no earlier-layer item is recorded after the decision.

## 4. P6-M4 — rooms and briefings (`0044_executive_rooms_and_briefings`)

Schema `executive`: rooms (the package owner's; members are named humans; cadence; a review is a
member's act recorded on the room and the package; review overdue is a fact of the clock, said in
words), briefings (`BRF@v1`, append-only) composed deterministically from stored records under the
reader's `known_at` since a **bound** prior: what changed (evidence, claims, runs, branch flips,
warnings, package events, dissent) with truth state, freshness and source state (live / replayed /
degraded / blocked / operator-upload / internal, from the readiness inputs), why it matters through
`graph.dependencies`, who owns it, which window is closing (warning responses, the next review,
approval expiries, the decision deadline) ordered by time left; the content digest over watermark,
items, windows, source states and source records; a narrative is optional, labelled, cites only
included items and sits outside the digest; retrieval enforces room membership at read time.

**Harness** `test/int/phase6-briefings.test.ts` — 6/6.

## 5. P6-M5 — monitoring, outcomes, closure (`0045_decision_monitoring_and_outcomes`)

Breaches: warnings raised after the decision on the version's indicators and branches, recorded
once per condition and warning, routed to the condition's owner with the window, on the package and
the room; review overdue recorded once per due date. The `OUT` is the second and last bounded write
into the strategy graph (`decision.outcome`): by the owner or the action owner, for one criterion of
the approved choice, citing an admitted **observed** twin element of the criterion's unit; the chosen
option being simulated, Phase 5's reconciliation of the chosen run's simulated element against it is
required and cited; nothing overwritten. Closure records the lessons as text on at least one outcome.

**Harness** `test/int/phase6-monitoring.test.ts` — 7/7 (incl. the walk reaching the package's DEC).

## 6. P6-M6 — the three bounded agents (`0046_executive_agents_and_runs`)

Registration is the tenant or platform administrator's: the principal of kind `agent` with the
agent's role is created on the identity authority first, then the registry row with owner,
escalation target, budgets and stop conditions. A run is opened and closed by the agent under its
**own session** (`executive.decision_agent_session_open` — Phase 1's shape; placed in the
`executive` schema so the Phase 0 authority matrix frozen at 0021 stays untouched; `eye_identity`
reaches this one port), with its trigger recorded (operator or scheduler). The decision agent drafts
option cards into a draft; its attempt to propose is refused at the PDP and recorded on the run and
in the audit; approve, dissent and commit are refused at the PDP **and** at the port by principal
kind with the API bypassed. The briefing agent evaluates the room's conditions and composes within
a read budget — a budget hit stops before anything is admitted and escalates to the named human on
the room. The reporting agent renders with SYNTHETIC marks, truth states and attribution and refuses
beyond its clearance. The planner binds a room's cadence to the existing scheduler on its own job
kind and queue (`exec:<t>:<d>:briefing`), reconciled at startup. The workflow contract is read
from the governed events (`executive.workflow_of`).

**Harness** `test/int/phase6-agents.test.ts` — 9/9 (real Redis for the promoted tick).

## 7. P6-M7 — workspaces, Act VI, browser

**Decisions** and **Briefings** workspaces (`apps/web/app/decisions`, client `apps/web/lib/decisions.ts`),
linked from every shell; states in words, `SYNTHETIC` on every simulated consequence, uncertainty in
words, the choice, dissent across every version, approvals with their standing, the C3 commitment,
breaches and outcomes, Replay with the five layers, cut-offs and unavailable artefacts; rooms with
members, cadence and review overdue in words; briefings with source states, windows ordered by time
left, agent-produced marked, narrative labelled. Receipts only from authoritative responses.

### 7.1 The demonstration — a FRESH deployment (2026-09-09)

Acts I–V were replayed on a **new** `eye_demo` after the repository's own virgin procedure
(`scripts/demo.sh`: fresh containers, regenerated local secret handoff, migrations, audited bootstrap,
acceptance **58/58**), then `scripts/phase6/seed-decisions.mjs` — Act VI, **0 problems** (transcript
in the run log): two synthetic personas created by the platform administrator (L. Brandt, decision
owner; S. Okafor, executive approver); the DEC *January corridor collapse — response* declared by
J. Weber through Phase 3's route; act V's control and four interventions on it; the three agents
registered; the decision agent drafted five option cards and its proposal was refused (`EYE-AUT-001`,
recorded on its run); the owner carded *wait* (unsimulated), set the terms and the choice and
proposed; M. Dvořák dissented; the owner's own approval was refused (403, audited); S. Okafor
approved version 1; the choice changed to *draw-down + reroute* → version 2, fresh approval;
L. Brandt committed under `decision.commit` at **C3** (the envelope claimed C2; the route pinned C3);
a second commit refused naming the first; the room with weekly cadence; the briefing agent composed
the room's briefing (272 items since no prior; sources: EU sanctions live, World Bank live, GDELT
replayed, PortWatch blocked, ECB degraded, NORDWERK/Comtrade/advisories operator-upload); after the
commitment the separately identified synthetic upload `outcomes-2024Q1.csv` (document time
2024-04-10, recorded now), the chosen run's exact output (0 line-stop days) as a simulated element,
the plant's actual 3 days as an observed element established from the record, Phase 5's
reconciliation, the `OUT` (target ≤ 0: **not met**); the replay by S. Okafor and by M. Dvořák: same
content digest, different invocation records; the reporting agent's render.

Disclosed deviations in the seed: (a) Phase 0 has no governed route that binds a **second** role to
an existing human and Phase 0 is frozen, so the owner's `decision_authority`, the approver's
`executive` and the observer's `executive` are bound by the administrator through the database
controller (as the harness fixtures bind roles) — the seed prints it; (b) a commit through an agent
session and a C4 envelope are refused in the harness, not attempted through the API (no agent token
exists outside the product); (c) the ECB live backfill hit the publisher's egress timeout on every
attempt today (`data-api.ecb.europa.eu` answered nothing in 40 s from this machine) — the ECB source
is active at contract v2 with **no live evidence** in this fresh run, which is why its source state
reads *degraded* and why one pre-existing Phase 4 browser check fails (§7.2).

### 7.2 Browser

`npx playwright test -c playwright.demo.config.ts` (installed Chrome, against the fresh
demonstration): Phase 6 spec **3/3** (`evidence/phase6-browser/13-decisions.png`, `14-replay.png`,
`15-briefings.png`); the Phase 4/5 spec **11/12** — the one failure is *overview counts validated
forecasts by both modes*, which expects the ECB forecast's retrospective validation and therefore the
ECB backfill that could not be collected today (external; not a Phase 6 change). Two Phase 6 defects
were found by the browser and fixed: the room object code `ROOM` did not fit the envelope contract's
three-letter code (now `DRM`), and the seven Phase 6 roles were missing from `identity.self.read`
(the shell resolves scope from the server's answer about who you are; the same class of defect
Phase 3's Graph shell had found).

## 8. Regression at the candidate (local)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Unit (`apps/api` `pnpm test`) | 39 files, 2136 passed; hermetic meta 9 passed |
| Integration `test:int:all` (phases 1–6) | 41 files, **739 passed** |
| Phase 0 acceptance (fresh stack, in `demo.sh`) | 58/58 |
| Post-C18 upgrade check (`verify-0022-upgrade.mjs`) | PASS — virgin database migrated from empty (47 files), schema digests match, Phase 1–2 suites on upgraded data 274/274 |
| Module boundaries (`pnpm boundaries`) | no violations (475 modules) |
| gitleaks over the branch's commits | no leaks |
| Web typecheck and build | clean; `/decisions`, `/decisions/briefings` |

**CI at the candidate `f702c532`** (reported apart from the local checks above): run
34323205261 — `build-test` **success**, `browser-regression` **success**, `supply-chain` **failure at
C15** (the tracked pinned-runner gate; independent of this branch, red since the util-linux CVEs of
#39) with the FINAL C16/C17 steps **skipped** behind it (patched-image recheck, target-resolved
closure, manifests, licence inventory, CycloneDX validation, evidence archive); run 34323205274 —
`C19 lifecycle` **success** (lifecycle on ubuntu and macOS, foreign-checkout pinning, delivery-chain
dry run). The runnable checks are green; the FINAL steps are not run, not passed.

## 9. An incident during M7, recorded plainly

The first Phase 6 commit had picked up a `.eye-local` **symlink** from a worktree (the ignore
pattern `.eye-local/` covers the directory, not a symlink of that name). Checking the branch out in
the main tree then replaced the real local credential and vault directory with that symlink, and the
ignored contents — the generated secret handoff and the evidence vault of the previous
demonstration — were gone (no local snapshot held them). Consequences: the branch history was
rewritten before push so no commit tracks the path, `.gitignore` now also ignores a symlink of that
name, and the demonstration deployment was rebuilt **virgin** through the repository's own procedure
(regenerated handoff, fresh databases, acts I–VI replayed). The observed state of the previous
demonstration (including the live scheduled-collection ticks recorded in `SCHEDULED_COLLECTION.md`)
stands as recorded at its commits; it no longer exists on this machine.

## 10. Deviations from the plan's letter, each bounded

- `identity.decision_agent_session_open` is `executive.decision_agent_session_open` (same shape;
  the Phase 0 schemas are frozen by the C14 matrix at 0021).
- The plan's `packages` impact bucket is realised through the existing `decisions` bucket: a package
  is reached through its `DEC`, which rests on the cited runs and evidence.
- The Model Gateway is not called for a narrative; the narrative contract (labelled, cites only
  included items, outside the content digest) is in place and takes text from a human or an agent.
- "Series points" in the known layer are covered by the evidence versions the series were assembled
  from; point-level replay is not separately enumerated.
- A refused commit rolls its transaction back, so the refusal is the PDP denial and audit record,
  not a package event.
- Room object code `DRM` (envelope codes are three letters).

## 11. The review of PR #46 at `09abd095` — reproduced at the harness, then corrected (NOT recorded as closed)

Codex's review executed the services and the PDP with doubles and inspected the SQL without executing
it: fifteen correctness expectations failed, seven controls passed. This pass reproduced every
database consequence through the existing database, controller, identity and Redis harness BEFORE
changing anything (`test/int/phase6-review-corrections.test.ts`, 25 cases, one per consequence with
its positive control), then corrected them with one forward migration, `0048_phase6_review_corrections`
(0041–0047 untouched), and the services. The suite is kept as the regression. Evidence classes stay
apart: §11.1 is the harness before and after, §11.2 the refutations found at the boundary, §11.3
the other checks, §11.4 CI at the exact head, §11.5 what remains.

### 11.1 Reproduction before, correction after

Against the reviewed head (migrations through 0047, services at `09abd095`) the suite ran twice:
first 7 of 7 cases of items 1–2 failed as expected and the fixtures of items 3–7 needed two
corrections of their own (recorded in §11.2); then **25 of 25 failed**, each on the assertion that
names the consequence. Against the corrected head **25 of 25 pass**.

| # | Consequence reproduced (the failing assertion before) | Correction (0048 + services) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `decision.live_approvals` counted a role-based approval after the approver's `decision_approver` binding was revoked (`'1'` where `'0'` was expected); `holds_role` said `true` for a revoked `decision_authority` binding; the package's displayed standing said `live` | `approver_eligibility` and `holds_role` read only bindings with `revoked_at IS NULL`; the package view marks `live` from the port's own recount, never a local re-derivation; the web says "the approver is no longer eligible" |
| 2 | `set_option` accepted an EVD recorded after the version's `known_at`, an EVD whose event fell after `observed_through`, a foreign digest, a citation naming a record of another type, a run on a twin version opened after `known_at`; it stored the caller's `{"made_up": true}` uncertainty and `public` controls | `set_option` is dropped and recreated (returns jsonb): each citation must be a recorded object of its kind at the version and digest recorded, by `known_at` and `observed_through`; a cited run must be completed and rest on inputs (its twin version's `known_at`/`observed_through`) that obey the cut-offs — it may complete after `known_at`; uncertainty (method `derived-at-port@2`, the run's `sensitivity.factors` and relative, `outside_envelope`, `validation_status`, `inherited_validation`, the twin's validation), controls (`decision.fold_controls`) and synthetic state are derived by the port; the service returns what the port derived |
| 3 | APR and CMT headers carried `internal`/null over a version folded to `confidential` with a licence; RPL carried null rights; a briefing over a warning-only interval folded to `internal`/`false` | APR and CMT inherit the version's fold; RPL folds the version and the known layer; OUT folds the observed element and the version; BRF folds every item — EVD/CLM, the SIM record of each run, the WRN record of each warning, the scenario's FCT for a flip, the package's fold for its events — and the room's package |
| 4 | a domain analyst member read a room briefing under purpose `research`; read a briefing folded to `confidential`; listed it; read the confidential package; a non-member analyst replayed a package with a room | `decision/clearance.ts`: clearance from role bindings (administrators/auditor restricted; executive, owner, authority, domain admin confidential; others internal); briefing get/list, replay and package get require membership where a room exists, the purpose the record was admitted for (its header's `purpose_scope`) and a covering clearance; briefing get returns `availability.unavailable` (withdrawn, deleted, not accessible, above clearance) beside the unchanged content; agent run outputs are withheld from readers whose clearance does not cover the run's package |
| 5 | a warning raised after a briefing's `known_at` was one of its windows; a later acknowledgement, health verdict and review changed the earlier digest; the next briefing used the prior's `composed_at` and skipped a review recorded after the prior's `known_at`; the replay's observed warning changed state after an acknowledgement | warnings, their state (from `prediction.warning_events`), the room's next review (from `room_events`), the approvals that stood and the version open to approval (from `package_events`), source health and attempts are all read AS OF `known_at`; the interval is `(prior.known_at, known_at]` with `prior_known_at` in the watermark and checked by `compose_briefing`; `replay_layers` reads warning state and OUT status as of `as_of` (`decision.warning_state_as_of`, `decision.strategy_status_as_of`), the OUT's title from its immutable canonical record |
| 6 | `record_outcome` accepted a same-unit travel-days element for the line-stop criterion, an element on another twin, a period ending after the criterion's date, an observation known before the decision | `set_choice` requires `observed_on = twin:<element key>`; `record_outcome` binds the element to the criterion's `observed_on`, the twin to the twins the version's options ran on, the period (`valid_to` ≤ `by`), and the chronology (the twin version's `known_at` and the cited evidence's `recorded_at` after `decided_at`); a legitimate reconciliation of a different same-unit output records that other criterion and no other |
| 7 | no scheduler-triggered run closed on a cold process (`systemReaderCache` empty → 409); the startup reconciliation scheduled nothing; a reporting agent with `max_reads=0` finished with a full report and `reads=0`; the decision agent read before checking; the monitor task evaluated beyond its budget; elapsed exhaustion was checked after the work; a stop condition `when_the_moon_is_full` was accepted | `executive.decision_agent_run_open` reads the registration itself under the identity-operation capability and returns it (no reader is borrowed; `setSystemReader` is gone); `executive.briefings_to_reconcile()` asserts the schedule capability the worker already holds, because under it every RLS table hid the rooms; a `Meter` checks reads and elapsed time BEFORE each unit of work on every task; `max_items` and `on_degraded` are the supported stop conditions, validated at registration (service and port), evaluated before admission, recorded and escalated |

### 11.2 Refutations and fixture findings at the boundary

- **Item 1, partial refutation.** Phase 0's boundary bumps a principal's revocation epoch on any
  change to their role bindings, so the revoked person's own sessions are refused at once
  (`authority epoch changed`): a revoked authority cannot commit even before 0048 (the harness
  shows 403 at the pipeline; the port's `holds_role` is exercised directly and now says `false`).
  What the boundary did NOT prevent — and 0048 corrects — is the revoked approver's earlier approval
  still counting when another authority commits.
- **Item 3, OUT synthetic flag**: as Codex noted, it worked; no defect was invented. The OUT now also
  folds the element's and the version's rights, residency, retention and access policy.
- **Fixture findings, recorded plainly**: the first reproduction run stalled after item 1 because the
  fixture revoked and restored a shared approver's binding, and the epoch bump invalidated that
  approver's session for the rest of the file — the probes now use principals of their own; the
  item 6 fixture named a record locator absent from its CSV. Both are fixture corrections, not
  product ones.
- **A defect the review did not name**: the planner's startup reconciliation could never schedule a
  room. It read `executive.rooms_current` under the schedule capability, which carries no tenant, so
  FORCE-RLS hid every row; the 9/9 of `phase6-agents` had scheduled through a human's `/schedule` call.
  `executive.briefings_to_reconcile()` (0048) is the port the worker reads through now; COLD START and
  RESTART in the suite prove a scheduler-triggered run finishing with no human trigger in the process.

### 11.3 The other checks (separate evidence classes)
